Declare and initialize all variables (wins, losses, guesses remaining, and guessed letters)
    *in the html document, give an id to each of their values so they can be modified by the script via getelementbyid

Make an array consisting of all alphabetical letters

User inputs a key to generate a event:
    Use a function generating a random number to represent a random letter chosen by the computer 
    Check to see if key input is a letter with a loop and if statement:
        alert to suggest valid input if not
    if user's key matches the random letter:
        user wins with an alert and the game resets
    else:
        if key already in list of guessed numbers:
            alert to suggest valid input
        else:
            decrease guesses left by 1,
            if no guesses left:
                user loses with an alert and game resets
            else:
                add letter to list of guessed letters
