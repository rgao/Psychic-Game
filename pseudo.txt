Declare and initialize all variables (wins, losses, guesses remaining, and guessed letters)
    *in the html document, give an id to each of their values so they can be modified by the script via getelementbyid

Make an array consisting of all alphabetical letters

Use a function generating a random number to represent a random letter chosen by the computer 

User inputs a key to generate a event:
    if user's key matches the random letter:
        user wins and the game resets
    else:
        decrease guesses left by 1,
        if no guesses left:
            user loses and game resets
        else:
            add letter to list of guessed letters
